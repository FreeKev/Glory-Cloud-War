#Glory Cloud War
An online crusader fight-to-the-death for two players.

##Technologies Used
* HTML
* CSS
* Javascript
* JQuery
* Phaser

##Approach Taken
1. Researched platformer games and created basic layout screen
2. Added platforms and characters
3. Animated characters
4. Created kill-function for characters
  - Ability to jump-on enemy, but not die by hitting platforms
  - Added score-keeping
5. Loaded music and backgrounds
6. Created loading menu
7. Created win-function screen
  - Added restart and reset-score functions.
8. Made everything beautiful.

##Issues
* Loading screen and win screens were difficult because I didn't hard-refresh browser
* Score display on main window made difficult because of Phaser text issues

##More?
* Could create multiple levels (Differing platforms, etc.)
* Characters have a screen-wrap-around and aren't blocked by all world-bounds
* Body physics changed so that a character falls faster than he jumps
